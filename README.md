Hello Nick and Jesse!

Welcome to my small demo! I will be showing you a small preview of email automation.

If you would like to use this code in your own PC, please feel free to clone my repo by opening your Git Bash and typing:

$ git clone https://github.com/CarlosValenzuela1/email_automation.git

Once you have all the required files in your computer, we will need to install all the necessary libraries, to do this simply navigate inside of "dependencies" directory with your cmd or unix terminal.

Please make sure you have pip installed in your computer.
Then, we will write the following command to install all the necessary dependencies for this project:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

The current code is using my own account and password from my Microsoft Credential Manager, but feel free to add your own credentials and test it out!

Great! Now that you have installed all the mandatory libraries and you have updated my credentials, then you can use your IDE of preference or simply run the main.py file located at the root of this directory, here's an example using PowerShell:

$ python main.py

Have fun!
