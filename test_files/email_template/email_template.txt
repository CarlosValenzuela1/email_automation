Subject: Salary Report from Oct 2077
Hi Nick and Jesse,

Hope you’ve been enjoying our services so far. We’re looking forward to working with you.

I’m going to set up a plan for this project now. We like to use Smartly to manage our projects. Could you please let me know which one you prefer? We will set up a board for you there so you can monitor our progress.

I have also attached a document that details all the login details I need from you. Please add them there or share them with us through LastPass.

And if you have any questions, you can email me at carlos.valenzuela@outlook.com or call me at 911.

Thank you,

Carlos Valenzuela
